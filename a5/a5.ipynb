        "Suppose that you've been hired as a DS intern in a games research lab. In one of the recent research projects, researchers have investigated the influence of the appearance of AI agents on players' enjoyment of the game within the context of playing a space game. The game involved players collaborating with an AI agent to defend their spaceship against enemy spaceships. The researchers conducted an interesting experiment to compare three possible designs, despite the technical challenges. In this assignment, your supervisors would like your help in making an informed decision as to which design alternative to use for the representation of the AI agent in the game.\n",

        "Based on prior research, the researchers came up with three alternatives for the representation of the AI agent: voice-based, robotic avatar, and humanoid avatar:\n",

        "- The robotic avatar displays a robot head to represent the AI agent.\n",

        "The researchers were interested in the effect of avatar representation on game enjoyment, and you have been asked to analyze the data from an experiment designed to test which of these three designs would lead to better game enjoyment. For the experiment, they  recruited 240 participants and divided them into three groups of equal size to play the same game with one of the three avatar representations:\n",

        "* The first group played the game with the voice representation and provided self-reported ratings of their enjoyment of the game.\n",

Prior research indicates that the more embodied (having a bodily form) the representation of the avatar is, the more people engage in and enjoy the game. Therefore, the researchers predicted that the robot and human avatars would lead to greater game enjoyment, when compared to the voice representation. The researcher also predicted that the human avatar would lead to greater enjoyment levels compared to the robot avatar, as prior research shows the more human-like the avatar is, the more people like it.\n"

        "The output from your function should be formatted in a way that matches the sample output below. That said, your function shouldn't be hard-coded to the values shown in the output. The output of the function should always be based ont the arguments provided. You should carefully study the sample output and format your output accordingly. Figuring out how to do this is part of the assignment. The sample output is formatted using \"\\n\" and \"\\t\" and the other string formatting methods we've looked at in class. Use extra lines to properly format the ouput. The more readable, the better. Don't worry; you won't lose points for including an extra line or whitespace in your output. Simply make sure your output is not crammed and approximates the sample output as much as possible. \n",

This cannot be seen in the sample output but should be included in your code.\n",
